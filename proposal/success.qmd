# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

- The `econdataverse` meta-package and its underlying core packages published to CRAN 
- Function documentation, vignettes, and articles available via `pkgdown` websites
- 90%+ test coverage for all released packages
- At least 1,000 CRAN downloads within three months of release for `econdataverse`

## Measuring success

<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

- User adoption: number of CRAN downloads of `econdataverse` packages using `cranlogs`

## Future work

<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

- Expand support for additional economic data sources
- Develop Shiny apps for interactive data visualization using economic data
- Create educational materials for economics courses using R
- Implement advanced features like automatic data updating and versioning

## Key risks

<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

- Lack of user engagement
- Unexpected API changes and data access restrictions
- Difficulty maintaining packages long-term due to maintainers becoming unavailable
