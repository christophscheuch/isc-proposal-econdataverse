- **Lead Developer**: Christopher Smith, President of Promptly Technologies, is a seasoned R and Python developer who helped revamp the imfr package, a critical tool for R users accessing International Monetary Fund data. His background in data engineering and expertise in API development are essential for building reliable economic data pipelines.
