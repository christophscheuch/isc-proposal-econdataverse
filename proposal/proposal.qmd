## Overview

<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.

The [`econdataverse`](https://www.econdataverse.org/) initiative was conceived as a unified ecosystem of packages for economic data access and analysis, applying the proven principle that big things get built by creating strong, durable building blocks that can be reliably stacked together. By enforcing consistent function naming, tidy data formats, and cross-source compatibility, it will significantly reduce the time spent on data acquisition and preparation and facilitate the creation of reproducible workflows.

This initiative emerged directly from our work developing tools for economic policymakers in developing countries who are navigating critical climate investment decisions during periods of high debt stress. The project addresses a fundamental gap in the data infrastructure needed to support evidence-based economic policy.

The econdataverse will serve two distinct groups:

1. **Direct users** of R packages: Technical staff at international organizations, researchers, economists, and data analysts in developing country economic policymaking institutions who need efficient access to economic data

2. **Indirect beneficiaries**: High-level policymakers without R programming skills who will gain access to insights through Shiny applications, parameterized reports, and other interfaces powered by econdataverse packages

By building rock-solid data infrastructure components with comprehensive unit tests, continuous integration, and detailed documentation, econdataverse will create a foundation for both technical analysis and accessible policy tools.

This initiative will deliver direct benefits including:

- Supporting reproducible research with standardized access to economic data
- Providing programmatic access to novel data sources
- Lowering the learning curve for working with economic data sources
- Creating a scalable foundation for advanced economic data analysis
- Democratizing access to critical economic data for policymakers in developing countries
- Enabling faster, more informed responses to economic and climate challenges
- Saving organizations thousands of dollars in commercial data subscription costs

### Real-World Impact: Tools for Economic Policymakers

The econdataverse initiative is already demonstrating practical impact through the [Debt Path Explorer](https://tealinsights.shinyapps.io/nature_finance_debt_dynamics_app/), the first of several tools we're developing for economic policymakers from climate-vulnerable countries ([V20](https://www.v-20.org/)). This web application, powered by our [`imfweo`](https://teal-insights.github.io/imfweo/) package, helps policymakers understand how sustainability targets could affect their debt trajectories without expensive data subscriptions or consultant fees. It transforms complex economic data into accessible insights and will be presented to policymakers for feedback at the spring IMF/World Bank Meetings, enabling rapid refinement based on real user needs.

The project will develop modular R packages, each targeting major economic data sources that are frequently used in economic analysis but historically difficult to access due to API inconsistencies or unavailability of APIs. The currently released or planned packages include:

- `wbids` (released to CRAN on 2024-11-15): World Bank International Debt Statistics (IDS) API, critical for sovereign debt sustainability analysis
- `wbwdi` (released to CRAN on 2025-02-25): World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) API, a large number of country or region-level indicators for various contexts
- `owidapi` (released to CRAN on 2025-02-27): Our World in Data (OWID) API, open-source data for long-term economic trends and social indicators
- `uisapi` (released to CRAN on 2025-03-06): UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) API, education and research data relevant for policy analysis
- `imfweo` (prototyped on GitHub): IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), global economic projections and country-level economic performance
- `oecdoda` (planned): OECD Official Development Assistance (ODA), aid flow and development finance tracking

Additional supporting tools to address cross-source compatibility and ease of use:

- `econid` (in development): standardization and conversion utilities for country, region, and institution identifiers used in economic datasets
- `econtools` (planned): common economic data analysis utilities

### Minimum Viable Product

For the initial release of `econdataverse`, we will focus on:

- Core packages for the primary data sources (IDS, WDI, OWID, UIS, WEO, ODA)
- Core packages for combining and analyzing economic data (`econid`, `econtools`)
- A unified meta-package ensuring seamless cross-source access (`econdataverse`)
- Documentation and vignettes that combine multiple data sources for modeling and visualizations
- Compliance with the CRAN Repository Policy

### Architecture

The `econdataverse employs` a modular architecture inspired by the principle that "big things get built by making strong, durable building blocks." Each package features robust CI/CD pipelines and comprehensive unit tests that quickly identify and isolate potential issues. Users can selectively load individual packages rather than the entire suite, eliminating unnecessary dependencies and optimizing resource utilization.

This architectural approach enables both immediate practical applications and future expansion, allowing the components to be recombined in ways we haven't yet imagined to tackle emerging economic challenges.

### Assumptions

- Data sources wonâ€™t undergo major breaking changes with respect to accessability
- The R community values consistent interfaces and tidy data approaches
