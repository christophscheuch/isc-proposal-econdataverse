# The Proposal

<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview

<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

The [`econdataverse`](https://www.econdataverse.org/) initiative was conceived as a unified ecosystem of packages for economic data access and analysis, applying modern software engineering principles to streamline workflows and enhance reproducibility. By enforcing consistent function naming, tidy data formats, and cross-source compatibility, it will significantly reduce the time spent on data acquisition and preparation and facilitate the creation of reproducible workflows.

This initiative will directly benefit the R community by:

- Supporting reproducible research with standardized access to economic data
- Providind programmatic access to novel data sources
- Lowering the learning curve for working with economic data sources
- Creating a scalable foundation for advanced economic data analysis

The project will develop modular R packages, each targeting major economic data sources that are frequently used in economic analysis but historically difficult to access due to API inconsistencies or unavailability of APIs. The currently released or planned packages include:

- `wbids` (released to CRAN on 2024-11-15): World Bank International Debt Statistics (IDS) API, critical for sovereign debt sustainability analysis
- `wbwdi` (released to CRAN on 2025-02-25): World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI) API, a large number of country or region-level indicators for various contexts
- `owidapi` (released to CRAN on 2025-02-27): Our World in Data (OWID) API, open-source data for long-term economic trends and social indicators
- `uisapi` (released to CRAN on 2025-03-06): UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) API, education and research data relevant for policy analysis
- `imfweo` (planned): IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO), global economic projections and country-level economic performance
- `oecdoda` (planned): OECD Official Development Assistance (ODA), aid flow and development finance tracking

Additional supporting tools to address cross-source compatibility and ease of use:

- `econid` (in development): standardization and conversion utilities for country, region, and institution identifiers used in economic datasets
- `econtools` (planned): common economic data analysis utilities

### Minimum Viable Product

For the initial release of `econdataverse`, we will focus on:

- Core packages for the primary data sources (IDS, WDI, OWID, UIS, WEO, ODA)
- Core packages for combining and analyzing economic data (`econid`, `econtools`)
- A unified meta-package ensuring seamless cross-source access (`econdataverse`)
- Documentation and vignettes that combine multiple data sources for modeling and visualizations
- Compliance with the CRAN Repository Policy

### Architecture

The `econdataverse` employs a modular architecture that maximizes efficiency and maintainability while ensuring seamless integration across diverse data sources. Each package features robust CI/CD pipelines and comprehensive unit tests that quickly identify and isolate potential issues. Users can selectively load individual packages rather than the entire suite, eliminating unnecessary dependencies and optimizing resource utilization.

### Assumptions

- Data sources wonâ€™t undergo major breaking changes with respect to accessability
- The R community values consistent interfaces and tidy data approaches
