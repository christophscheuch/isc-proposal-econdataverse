# The Problem

Economic data is essential for research and policy analysis, yet it remains highly fragmented, inconsistently formatted, and difficult to access efficiently through R. While some data is available through public APIs, a significant portion exists in static formats such as spreadsheets and reports, requiring time-consuming manual processing.

This challenge has profound real-world consequences. Decision-makers in developing countries often lack the resources to process complex economic data effectively, forcing them to:

1. Pay tens of thousands of dollars annually for commercial data platforms (like HAVER Analytics) that merely provide better interfaces to freely available data
2. Hire expensive external consultants to perform basic data integration tasks
3. Make critical policy decisions with incomplete or outdated information

For example, in sovereign debt sustainability analysis, policymakers must integrate World Bank debt statistics with IMF economic forecasts to evaluate sustainability. A task that should take minutes can consume hours or days of analyst time reconciling inconsistent country codes, standardizing formats, and validating calculations. This inefficiency is compounded every time a new data source needs to be integrated or when analysis must be updated with new releases.

These challenges not only waste resources but also significantly impair the ability of governments, particularly in resource-constrained environments, to respond to pressing economic, climate, and social challenges with evidence-based policies.
